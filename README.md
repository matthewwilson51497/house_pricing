Building linear regression models to predict housing prices.

For this project, I used a dataframe consisting of specifications of various homes sold. The end goal was to build a linear regression model that could adequately predict house prices. To execute this, I went through a process of cleaning the data, exploring the data, building visualizations and finally quantifying all the data so it could be used in an ordinary least squares analysis. After completing several analyses I was able to build a model that can correctly predict 73% of the house prices with the given data.
